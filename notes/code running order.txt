assuming everything is starting fresh, this is the order to handle the data to make sure all is correct and ready for final analysis:
this file should be in "final-project/"
all references to files are relative to this location

THIS IS ALL TO BE DONE ON THE SCIAMA SUPERCOMPUTER.

1. within ./datasets/, verify there are the following 5 folders. if not, download them from kaggle's cornell lab of ornithology competitions page.
    a. ./datasets/birdsong-recognition/
    b. ./datasets/birdclef-2021/
    c. ./datasets/birdclef-2022/
    d. ./datasets/birdclef-2023/
    e. ./datasets/birdclef-2024/
2. also within ./datasets/, create a new folder, titled birdsongs-combined
3. within each folder listed in step 1, they should all contain a subfolder along the lines of "train_audio" OR "train_short_audio"
4. in the order the folders are listed in step 1, move the contents of each above mentioned folder into datasets/birdsong-recognition/train_audio/
5. when moving the contents in order, if you are prompted, choose to replace all existing files with the ones you are currently moving.
6. verify that 992 folders and 128735 files exist in birdsongs-combined/train_audio/
7. from here, run the code located in ./datasets/delete_duplicates.ipynb
8. verify that 992 folders and 112861 files exist in birdsongs-combined/train_audio/
9. run ./code/sciama_convert_mp3_to_wav.ipynb
10. if you find there are some files that are in the "erroneous_files" section of the above notebook, you can choose to delete them or manually repair/transfer them to the train_audio_wav/ folder.
11. run ./code/sciama_verify_wav_folder_files.ipynb
12. your final folder for analysis should be located in /mnt/lustre/peprmint/train_audio_wav/
