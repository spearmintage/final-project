TODO:
- filter out (and get statistics):
	- MULTI-LABEL AUDIO FILES
	- bad quality audio files (histogram of "rating" from metadata) (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, ..., 4.5, 5.0)
	- folders with low quantity of audio files (AFTER ABOVE 2 TECHNIQUES DONE)
- implement multiple types of deep learning models on dataset
