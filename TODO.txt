DONE:
- obtained and merged all datasets
- handled duplicate XC ids

models to learn/use/apply to audio files:
- GMM (gaussian mixture model)
- DNN (deep neural network)
- RNN (recurrent neural network)
- CNN (convolutional neural network)
- model FUSION ???


TO DO (in this order):
- investigate audio file analysis with ML models (look into RESEARCH PAPERS folder)
	- RNNs/LSTMs
	- CNN on mel-spectrogram images
	- other neural networks on temporal data
	- supervisor mentioned LLMs? do research, avoid using things like chatgpt or HUGE llm models. development of personal LLM maybe
	- audio file splitting with above bullet points
	- send PDF files of papers to supervisor
- investigate ways of extracting/viewing audio file data in python
	- MP3 analysis
	- OGG analysis
	- raw file data in binary
	- visualisations
		- mel-spectrograms
		- spectrograms
		- pitch/frequency similar to audacity
- standardise data
	- same bit rate
	- same sampling rate
	- audio file length (audio file splitting maybe)
- create prototype model with 10-20 random classes
	- train different techniques
	- compare techniques
	- optimise accuracy/minimise loss
	- improve training/testing time
	- utilise GPU training
