combinations of all the metadata files are found in "birdsongs-combined/final_metadata.xlsx"

in the FOLDER_SPECIES_TABLE sheet, there are a total of 1,014 unique species. (different to the 992 calculated in PID)
the reason this was different was because 22 folders contained more than one local species.
17 of these 22 were due to local names of the bird species, or the species name in the dataset was spelled differently, or had a hyphen, etc.
5 of the 22 were of concern due to the difference in the name and the following are below:

folder	species 1		species 2		investigation results

amepip	American Pipit & 	Buff-bellied Pipit	Buff-bellied Pipit was the former name of the American Pipit.
banswa	Bank Swallow & 		Sand Martin		Sand Martin is known as Bank Swallow in the Americas.
gnwtea	Eurasian Teal & 	Green-winged Teal	They are both local names for the same bird.
yelwar	Mangrove Warbler & 	Yellow Warbler		Mangrove is a group of subspecies of Yellow Warbler.
yerwar	Myrtle Warbler & 	Yellow-rumped Warbler	Myrtle is a subspecies of Yellow-rumped Warbler.

meaning, because there are no actual bird species differences, 
there are a total of 992 different species of bird to classify,
and every folder does contain 1 species of bird.

in the COMBINED_TABLE_PLAINTEXT sheet, there were 11,766 files that were duplicate files among all 5 datasets.
however, it was also the case that 15,874 files had the same xeno-canto ID but different file formats.
because all files in the "birdsong-recognition" dataset were mp3 files, and all other datasets only had ogg files, i decided to delete the mp3 files.
1) because older data tends to be historically inaccurate, even if by 1 year.
2) less mp3 files means less confusion between file data analysis in the future

determining the files to remove was a matter of logic. 
as files that had both mp3 and ogg files would have to be in the birdsong-recognition dataset, 
i sought to find the mp3s in birdsong-recognition that already had OGG formats, and delete the mp3s.

out of the 21,375 files from that dataset, 5,501 remained.
of the 15,874 that had to be removed, only 6 were removed due to different reasons than sharing mp3/ogg formats.

these 6 were because the classification of the bird species changed over time.
easmea/XC406586.mp3: Eastern Meadowlark -> Western Meadowlark
louwat/XC136316.mp3: Louisiana Waterthrush -> Rufous-capped Warbler
louwat/XC502062.mp3: Louisiana Waterthrush -> Northern Waterthrush
prawar/XC376774.mp3: Prairie Warbler -> Field Sparrow
rebmer/XC475655.mp3: Red-breasted Merganser -> Northern Shoveler
weskin/XC351819.mp3: Western Kingbird -> Cassin's Kingbird

thus, i then deleted the 15,874 duplicate files listed in the FILES_TO_DELETE sheet.

this left my final dataset with the most up to date classifications of every bird, 
with no xeno-canto ID appearing more than once, regardless of file type.



after running the total_audio_length.ipynb file,
it is seen that the final resulting dataset contains
5653005 seconds
94216 minutes
1570 HOURS of audio footage.
