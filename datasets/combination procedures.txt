procedures to note for when writing dissertation

the "birdsongs-combined" folder contains a mixture of data from the following datasets (folders):
- birdsong-recognition
- birdclef-2021
- birdclef-2022
- birdclef-2023
- birdclef-2024

within the birdsongs-combined/train_audio folder, it has the following structure:
- each subfolder is a code for the name of a bird species, which has audio files containing (primarily) calls from that species
- these subfolders are taken from the "train_audio" folders of each respective dataset
- these files come in either .mp3 or .ogg format.
- there are numerous issues to tackle when merging these folders:
	- there are multiple files which are duplicates, because of being sourced from the same xeno-canto database.
		- this is handled on an incidental basis, when moving files to/from sources, some may be overwritten multiple times. 
		- there is no specific strategy to removing duplicates, so it is (in a sense) random.
	- some audio files exist as both .mp3 and .ogg files with the same file name.
		- this will be handled through investigation of which file type is easiest to work with, and deleting the opposite corresponding file.
	- multiple folders have different names despite belonging to the same bird species.
		- this will also be handled on a case by case basis, likely involving manually renaming folders/moving files.


after the following has been applied, the resulting folder should include 1 folder per bird species, with zero duplicate files (also includes multiple file types per xeno-canto ID).

the folder should also contain spreadsheet(s) containing metadata describing each folder and corresponding bird species.
- if there is a folder with no corresponding bird species, this folder will be deleted.
- if there are multiple folders containing the same bird species, they will be merged accordingly.

this should result in a dataset with complete enough data for preprocessing/cleansing/analysis.
